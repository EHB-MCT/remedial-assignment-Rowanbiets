# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission  
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at **[your.email@example.com]**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** – Minor impact issues may receive a private, written warning.
2. **Warning** – Continued issues or single more serious incidents may result in a public warning.
3. **Temporary Ban** – Repeated violations or severe incidents may result in temporary removal from community spaces.
4. **Permanent Ban** – Severe or repeated harassment, discrimination, or harmful behavior will result in a permanent ban.
